As a PhD student, you are constantly exploring the boundaries of what is possible in your field of research. Personally, I want to explore the potential of using advanced Machine Learning (ML) approaches in automotive applications. By leveraging cutting-edge deep learning techniques, the goal is to design models and systems that are efficient, effective, and interpretable. 
The interpretability of ML is relevant because it helps to build trust in ML systems and enables to have a clear understanding of how decisions are being made by machines. This becomes particularly important in situations where ML systems are used to make decisions that can have significant consequences, such as vehicle motion predictions in critical traffic scenarios.Â 

Lately, I've engaged in researching graph-structured learning approaches for reliable and interpretable long term-trajectory predictions in interactive within scenarios. Furthermore, my work focuses on developing innovative methods using generative models that can be applied to a wide range of real-world automotive applications. 

Join the journey as I explore the fascinating research and learn more about the promising future of ML in the automotive industry!
